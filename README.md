# Dodo Pizza

This project is a redesign of the Dodo Pizza [website](https://dodopizza.ng/lagos/gbagada), built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that provides features like server-side rendering and static site generation. It's bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
